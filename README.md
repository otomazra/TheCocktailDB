# TheCocktailDB
To everyone interested. I created a cocktail website with the API of ThecocktailDB.
Live link: https://thecocktaildb-production.up.railway.app/

On this website a visitor can roam through random drinks and click on any of them to see the details or search for his facorite one by its name.
Clicking on a specific drink takes the visitors to its details page where you can find the details like name, id, category, glass, alcohol, ingredients and their measures and the instructions on how to make it. This is just a first version of this website. A lot may and needs to be added and modified on both front-end and back-end sides.
